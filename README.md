<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Complete as many dishes for the customers as you can before the timer goes off! I made some special additions and changes to my version of the game, to make it play more similarly to the hit game "Overcooked!". This game was developed on Unity3D along with Blender for modelling required assets. It includes a tutorial for helping the player understand how the game works and an elaborate system of completing recipes by combining ingredients in the game. This game was created on Unity3D, taking inspiration from Code Monkeys' Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&t.</p>

<h2>Game Walk-through</h2>

<h3>Main Menu</h3>

</p>

<p>After launching the game, this is the screen the player will be looking at. The buttons the player can click on are "Play" and "Quit". In the future, I plan on adding the option for the player to pick a different skin to play in the game, but for now the player will play with the yellow skin.</p>

<h3>Pause Menu</h3>

</p>

<p>In this level, we introduce the concept of sprinting, with the idea that by using the sprint mechanism, the player can move faster and thus make longer jumps. The player must master the sprinting mechanic in order to move on to the next level.</p>

<h3>Options Menu</h3>

<p>In this level, we introduce the concept of crouching, with the idea that by using the crouching mechanism, the player can go past obstacles they would not be able to if they were standing up. By using that mechanic correctly, the player gets to move to the next level.</p>


<h3>Game Over</h3>

<p>In this level, we introduce the trampoline object, distinguished with a bright green color. By touching object with this green color, the player will be propelled upwards, thus being able to make higher jumps.</p>

<h3>Picking Up Ingredients</h3>

<p>This level is similar to a memory card game. By touching each button on the platform, a color will be revealed. The player must match the pairs of colored blocks and complete the puzzle. By doing so, the next level is unlocked.</p>
