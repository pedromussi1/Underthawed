### [Play the Game Here!](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-397102)


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Complete as many dishes for the customers as you can before the timer goes off! I made some special additions and changes to my version of the game, to make it play more similarly to the hit game "Overcooked!". This game was developed on Unity3D along with Blender for modelling required assets. It includes a tutorial for helping the player understand how the game works and an elaborate system of completing recipes by combining ingredients in the game. This game was created on Unity3D, taking inspiration from Code Monkeys' Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&t.</p>

<h2>Game Walk-through</h2>

<h3>Main Menu</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>After launching the game, this is the screen the player will be looking at. The buttons the player can click on are "Play" and "Quit". In the future, I plan on adding the option for the player to pick a different skin to play in the game, but for now the player will play with the yellow skin.</p>

<h3>Tutorial Screen</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>After pressing play on the main menu, the player will see a tutorial screen where the can see instructions on how to play the game and the controls needed to play the game. The player can close this screen and start the game by pressing the "Interact" button, which is set to the "E" key by default.</p>

<h3>Pause Menu</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lBjybs9.png" alt="Level 2"></kbd>
</p>

<p>After pressing play on the main menu, the player will be able to press the "Escape" button to open the Pause Menu. The pause menu offers a few options, including "Resume" which makes the player go back to the game normally, "Options" which opens a new menu for changing other ascpects in the game I will cover later, "Restart" which will play the game from the beginning, and "Main Menu" which goes back to the menu I talked about previously.</p>

<h3>Options Menu</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>In the options menu we can change things about the game such as the volume of sound effects, music, and keybinds for how the player moves and interacts with objects in the game.</p>

<h3>Game Over</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JAcQuYD.png" alt="Level 4"></kbd>
</p>

<p>When the timer ends, the Game Over screen is shown. On this screen the player can see how many recipes were delivered by the player, and gives the options for the player to click on the "Restart" or "Quit" buttons. "Restart" will play the game from the beginning and "Quit" will simply close the game.</p>

<h3>Picking Up Ingredients</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mWqgJOu.png" alt="Level 6"></kbd>
</p>

<p>In the game the player is required to pick up ingredients from their respective stations and that they can be used in making the recipes be asked for. The player must look at the station and press the interact button (by default the "E" key) to pick up the ingredient of that respective station. In the pictures above we have the player picking up bread and cheese.</p>

<h3>Cutting Tomatoes and Cabbages</h3>

</p>

<p>In the game the player is required to cut ingredients at cutting stations so that they can be used for completing recipes. The player must look at the station and press the interact alternate button (by default the "F" key) until the ingredient is fully cut. In the pictures above we have the player cutting tomatoes and cabbages.</p>

<h3>Cooking Patty</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

</p>

<p>The player has to cook a meat patty in order to make all types of burges. To do that the player gets an uncooked patty from the patty station, and lays it on the stove. By waiting for a bit, the patty gets cooked. If the player waits for too long, the patty will burn and cannot be used on making recipes anymore. A burnt patty is useless, so the player may want to dispose of it by using the trash counter.</p>

<h3>Using Trash</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bxjQ9Zm.png" alt="Level 7"></kbd>
</p>

<p>By holding an item and interacting with trash counter, the player will destroy that item and thus will have their hands free to pick up any other item they desire.</p>

<h3>Delivery Success</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6ws986f.png" alt="Level 7"></kbd>
</p>

<p>By following the recipe correctly and completing one of the dishes in the list, the player can now deliver the recipe. This is where the delivery counter comes in. By interacting with the delivery counter while holding a correct recipe, the player will deliver that dish and increase the amount of recipes delivered by one.</p>

<h3>Delivery Failed</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NFABh4T.png" alt="Level 7"></kbd>
</p>

<p>In case the player delivers an incorrect recipe to the delivery counter, that item will be lost and a message saying the delivery failed will be shown.</p>
